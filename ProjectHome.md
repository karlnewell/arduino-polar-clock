We're building a polar clock using an Arduino, some shift registers and a ton of LEDs. We will post pictures and such when we have one completed. In the 'Source' section, you'll find the code that we're running on the Arduino (look for polar\_clock/polar\_clock.pde).

Here is an example of the way we have the shift registers wired up:
